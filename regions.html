                        Liyue Harbor, Teyvat's largest harbor, is one of the many reasons why the nation of Liyue thrives in its well-off economic status as the richest land in Teyvat. The sheer amount of goods flowing to and from it is simply incomparable for other ports. Being a city directly influenced by China, Liyue culture reflects its real-life counterpart with food, clothing, literature, artistry, traditions, and other beliefs. The associated element with Liyue is Geo (stone).

                        <br>
                        <br>

                        Every year, during the Lantern Rite Festival, thousands of lanterns can be seen floating into the night sky — a Liyue event that one can not afford to miss, lighting the whole city with golden speckles of light when viewed from afar.

                        <br>
                        <br>

                        It is also the home of the legendary adepti. Namely, they are Xiao, Ganyu, Yanfei, Madame Ping, Moon Carver, Cloud Retainer, Mountain Shaper, the Stove God, and of course, Liyue's very archon, Zhongli or Rex Lapis.

                        <br>
                        <br>

                        The storyline in this region follows the Traveler as they search for their missing sibling, but things turn the wrong way when they encounter the 11th Harbinger, Tartaglia. He resurrects Osial, a sea serpent with three heads, in desperation to obtain Zhongli's Gnosis (a powerful object possessed by the Gods, which serves as a connection to Celestia).

                      <h2>General Information</h2>
                      <p>
                        Inazuma, the third region of Teyvat, is a country inspired by the Edo period of Japan and associated with the element of Electro (lightning). 

                        <br>
                        <br>

                        "An Isolated Archipelago Far East of Teyvat
                        Overcome endless thunderstorms and set foot on the islands of red maple and cherry blossoms. On winding shores and towering cliffs, and in forests and mountains full of secrets, witness the Eternity pursued by Her Excellency, the Almighty Narukami Ogosho." - Genshin Impact Official Website

                        <br>
                        <br>

                        In the past year relative to the current events of the game, the situation in Inazuma has made a drastic turn towards isolationism to achieve "eternity," locked down under the Sakoku Decree. Raiden, their archon, enacted the related Vision Hunt Decree, declaring that Visions, as gifts from the gods, should be in the sole hands of divinity — and is now rounding up all Visions in Inazuma to inlay them in the hands of a statue of the Thousand-Armed, Hundred-Eyed God. 

                        <br>
                        <br>

                        The Travel fights many foes in this arc: Raiden, the Inazuman Military, and the ever-so-present Fatui. But they also meet new friendly faces like Kokomi, Yae Miko, Gorou, Ayato, and Ayaka.

                        "The city of scholars located in the west-central part of Teyvat.
                        A fantastical nation of both lush rainforest and barren desert, where countless fruits of wisdom grow and are buried. Whether Travelers travel from afar through the forest to reach the academy city or delve deep into the desert to discover the historical ruins of the red desert, a wealth of valuable knowledge awaits them here." - Genshin Impact Official Website

                        <br>
                        <br>

                        Sumeru blends South Asian and Middle Eastern influences to create a scholarly paradise, keeping with its theme of wisdom. This is also supported by the introduction of the Sumeru Akademiya, the most famous school in all of Teyvat. This nation is also powered by Dendro (nature), which is seen through the lush greenery incorporated into the buildings and surroundings.

                        <br>
                        <br>

                        This nation is fairly new, spanning the release of three versions, but we already get to see its storyline building up with the introduction of Nahida, Dottore, Collei, Tighnari, Al Haitham, Nilou, and Cyno. The story arc also shows the return of the fan-favorite Scaramouche, another Fatui Harbinger like Tartaglia.
