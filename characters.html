            <p>
                Here are three of my favorite characters in Genshin:

                <a href="#xianglingmain" id="xianglingbutton">Xiangling</a>

                    <div class="column right" style="border: solid rgb(105, 92, 245)">
                      
                      <h2>General Information</h2>
                      <p>
                        
                        Yelan hails from the land of Liyue. She is an enigmatic individual who says she works for the Ministry of Civil Affairs yet appears on their registry as a non-entity. Additionally, she says she works at the Yanshang Teahouse, but in reality, she collaborates with Ningguang as an intelligence agent.

                        <br>
                        <br>

                        Personally, this is what I like about Yelan: her calm demeanor and flashy moveset. It really adds to the "coolness" of her character like a secret agent, and that makes it more enjoyable for me. Not to mention, Hydro is also my favorite element, and bows are my favorite weapon, so I knew when she got released, I had to get her, and I did. Now, I use her as my main character when I play.

                        
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        
                        From a META (Most Affective Tactics Available) standpoint, Yelan is quite overpowered with her raw single-target damage. Being a Hydro unit, she can apply the element frequently to support other characters via reactions like Vaporize, Bloom, and Electro-Charged. Her elemental skill also increases her mobility, which is incredibly convenient for open-world exploration. Additionally, her high base HP gives her the tankiness to survive fights and remove the compromise for shields and heavy healing.

                      <h2>General Information</h2>
                      <p>

                        A renowned chef from Liyue. She's extremely passionate about cooking and excels at making her signature hot and spicy dishes.

                        <br>
                        <br>

                        She co-owns the Wanmin Restaurant with her father, Chef Mao, and serves as its head chef. In her role as a chef, Xiangling isn't hesitant to experiment with new techniques or "strange" ingredients, giving her dishes occasionally a distinctive flavor. Some of her "interesting" ingredient choices are slime condensate, mist flowers, and even various insects.

                        <br>
                        <br>

                        Xiangling's bubbly and adventurous personality strikes excitement into the players. She's also accompanied by her cute little sidekick Guoba, the orange bear.

                        <br>
                        <br>

                        Being a character released since the beginning of the game, it is impressive for her to stand against the test of time, as she is still one of the best Pyro units in the game. Damage, elemental application, and other supportive abilitiesâ€”she's got them all. Xiangling is versatile with her artifact and weapon choices, so even starter players can use her effectively.

                      <h2>General Information</h2>
                      <p>

                        Chongyun, a Liyue exorcist who was born with a surplus of yang (positive) energy, is so powerful that he hasn't really seen a spirit since they run away as he approaches. He is extremely sensitive to heat and intense emotion due to the excess yang energy, which has produced some rather...surprising outcomes.
                       
                        <br>
                        <br>

                        He was my first main when I started playing the game. I was appealed to his kit, and I am a big fan of his character design. The pale blue hair and the white exorcist robe were unique to my eyes as these types of clothing are often seen in darker and richer tones. Fun fact: I even cosplayed him for Halloween. Okay, back to his kit. His talents are versatile while dealing a huge frontload of damage. Chongyun's elemental skill slams a sword onto the enemy and leaves a field of ice that transforms any incoming damage into Cryo damage. Meanwhile, his ultimate creates three giant Cryo swords that fall to the enemy. 

                        <br>
                        <br>

                        Chongyun's stand in the META is mediocre at best, as he is overshadowed by better characters. But having an optimized strategy is not all that important. What matters is that you have fun. It's just a game, after all.
